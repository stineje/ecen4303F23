These are Magic technology files.
They contain stacked vias, which are supported
in Magic 7.3.

These techfiles have been created with
Tim Bach's techfile converter from the
original Mosis techfiles by J. Sondeen.

ami05.tech	SCN3ME_SUBM.30.tech27
ami035.tech	SCN4M_SUBM.20.TSMC.tsch27
tsmc025.tech	SCN5M_SUBM.15.tech27
tsmc018.tech	SCN6M_SUBM.10.tech27

To install these techfiles, put them in
$CAD_HOME/lib/magic/sys
where $CAD_HOME points to your Magic 7.3
installation.

Many thanks to Tim Bach for creating
Magic 7.3 and the techfile converter.
