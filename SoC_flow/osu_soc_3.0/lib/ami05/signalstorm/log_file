Warning: All Buffers in the library have output slew ratio greater than
         max value of 0.5
Info   : Wireload models are not present in the library
Info   : Signal integrity checks not present in the library
Warning: Slew_limit for input pins is not defined for one or more cells in the
         library
Warning: Slew_limit for output pins is not defined for one or more cells in the
         library
Warning: Slew_limit for bidirectional pins is not defined for one or more
         cells in the library
Info   : ROUTING_LAYER construct is not defined in the library
Info   : MIN_POROSITY construct is not defined in the library
Warning: MPWL arc not defined for the following cases (<cell>-><pin>)
         LATCH->CLK
Info   : SetUp/Hold Data is negative for all sequential cells in the
         library
Tool specific Checks:
=====================
Signal integrity Analysis tools specific checks:

Warning: Signal integrity construct(s):
             CT_TOLERANCE
             CT_RES_LOW
             CT_RES_HIGH
             VDROP_LIMIT
         is(are) not present in the library. This will affect quality of
         results of the Signal Integrity Analysis tools
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Power Analysis tools specific checks:

Warning: Negative Data values found in Energy data table for the 
         following cell(s)
         FAX1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Synthesis tools specific checks:

Warning: Synthesis construct(s)
             pad_type
             is_clock_gating_cell
             clock_gating_integrated_cell
             complimentary_pin
             fault_model
         is(are) not present in the library. This will affect the quality of
         results of Synthesis tools
