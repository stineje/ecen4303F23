How to setup the tech.dpux
--------------------------

* Create mosis_subm_30.lef with all the process details

* invoke "hld2lef"

* Set "mosis_subm_30.lef", "osu05_stdcells", "./tech"

* For min grid set lambda/2, which is 0.15

* This will create the initial tech.dpux

* It is complete, except for the GDS II layers

* run "abstract -tech ."

* In the technology editor, read in the map file

* Save techfile and exit

* Now will be the final tech.dpux created

* Now do "run_abstract"

* In abstract.scr and mosis_subm_30.lef, the dbu is always "1000"
