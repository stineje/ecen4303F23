These are the IIT standard cells for 0.35um.
They have to be used with the NCSU_TechLib_tsmc04_4M2P technology file.

The IO pads are imported as supplied by Mosis. DIVA reports DRC violations,
however Magic reports no errors. Provided as is, use at own risk.

The TSMC techfile has the same dimensions as AMI and is used until AMI
becomes available

Voltage: 3.3V
1 Lambda=0.2u
