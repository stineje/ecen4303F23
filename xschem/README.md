This file contains schematics using the xschem program from https://xschem.sourceforge.io/stefan/index.html.  Due to some of the open-source issues with multiple files.  These files are used for Layout vs. Schematic (LVS) with netgen.  The simulation files are different and found in the sim subdirectory underneath.  They are maintained separately until we figure out how to make it into 1 schematic.
